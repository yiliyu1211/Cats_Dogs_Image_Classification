# Cats_Dogs_VGG16-image-classification

This project is from kaggle cats vs. dogs competition, which is about classifying cats and gods images through machine learning methods. I made some adjustments in VGG-16 nueral network structure, and enhance the prediction accuracy to 0.967.

Detailed descriptions and datasets (including training and testing) are here [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

My model is built through kaggle kernel and the code is provided. You can run it and download my model through h5 format, then try it on yourself!

(Fun fact: In my model, human faces are classified to be more similar to dogs' ....)
