# Cats_Dogs_VGG16-image-classification

**Data:**

This project is from kaggle cats vs. dogs competition, which is about classifying cats and gods images through machine learning methods. I made some adjustments in VGG-16 nueral network structure, and enhance the prediction accuracy to 0.967.

Detailed descriptions and datasets (including training and testing) are here [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

**Approach**

-- Model: VGG16 pretrained model through Kaggle kernel


(Fun fact: In my model, human faces are classified to be more similar to dogs' ....)
