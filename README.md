# Cats_Dogs_Image_Classification

## Data:

This project is from kaggle cats vs. dogs competition, which is about classifying cats and gods images through machine learning methods. 

Detailed descriptions and datasets (including training and testing) are here [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

## Approach 

-- Model: VGG16 pretrained model 

-- Enviornment: Training in Kaggle Kernel


## Results:

Prediction accuracy ~ 0.967.
