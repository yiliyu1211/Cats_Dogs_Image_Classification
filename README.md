# VGG16-image-classification

This project is from kaggle cats vs. dogs competition, which is about classifying cats and gods images through machine learning methods. I made some adjustments in VGG-16 nueral network structure, and enhance the prediction accuracy to 0.967.

Detailed descriptions and datasets (including training and testing) are here [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

My code is provided. You can try to download my model through h5 format and try it on your own!
