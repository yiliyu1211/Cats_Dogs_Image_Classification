# VGG16-image-classification

This project is from kaggle cats vs. dogs competition, which is about classifying cats and gods images through machine learning methods. 

Dataset is here [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

I made some adjustments in VGG-16 nueral network structure, and enhance the accuracy to 0.967.
